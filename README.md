# Solving-Sol y-a-v-a

✏️  A small site to host on a sub domain showing only my implementations of the [Solving Sol project](http://solvingsol.com/).

To be viewed at http://sol-lewitt.y-a-v-a.org/

## Fetching

Assuming a. you've got https://github.com/wholepixel/solving-sol forked and checked out and b. you've added some implementations, you'd modify add.js to point to the right directory name (in my case y-a-v-a), then run:

```
$ node add.js
```

And publish the result somewhere online!
